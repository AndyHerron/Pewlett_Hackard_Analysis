# Pewlett-Hackard employee database analysis

## Overview of analysis
Pewlett-Hackard is a huge company with a large number of employees who are about to reach retirement eligibility.  Company management has tasked us to compile some lists of data that
will help them deal with that situation.  They need to know how many employees are about to retire and from which departments, so that they may determine how to best move forward with
replacing those employees.


### Resources
* Data Sources: departments.csv, dept_manager.csv, dept_emp.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
* Software: pgAdmin 4, PostgreSQL
